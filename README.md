# React Firebase Auth (TypeScript)

Starter template for building authentication flows using **React + Firebase**, written in **TypeScript**.  
This project is designed to be a **boilerplate** for login/register systems with routing, validation, API calls (via Axios), and user context management — ready to extend and customize for real-world applications.

> ⚙️ Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [Firebase Auth + Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/), and [React 19](https://react.dev/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-firebase-auth-typescript.git
cd react-firebase-auth-typescript
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create `.env` file

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and set your Firebase credentials:

## 🔧 Firebase Setup Guide

Before running the project, make sure you have a Firebase project ready and follow these steps:

### 1. Enable Authentication
- Go to **Firebase Console** > **Build > Authentication**
- Click **"Get started"**
- Enable **Email/Password** as a Sign-in method

### 2. Create Firestore Database
- Go to **Firebase Console** > **Build > Firestore Database**
- Click **"Create database"**
- Choose **"Start in test mode"** (for development)
- Select a region (e.g., `asia-southeast1`)

### 3. Get Firebase config
- Go to **Project Settings** > **Your apps**
- Create a new **Web app** (</> icon)
- Copy your Firebase config and paste it into a `.env` file:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=...
```

> 🧪 Tip: You can use `.env.example` as a reference

## 📚 Inspiration & Credits

✨ This project was originally inspired by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x74LZmGmly8) on Firebase Authentication using React.  
✨ I initially followed the tutorial as a learning exercise, then rewrote it in TypeScript for better type safety and scalability. It has since been extended with additional features such as API integration via Axios, global configuration setup, and various improvements in structure, styling, validation, and overall developer experience.
